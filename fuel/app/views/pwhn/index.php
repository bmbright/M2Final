        <h3><u>Welcome to Pets with Human Names!</u></h3>

        <p>We are a pet shelter located in Fort Collins, Colorado, run by four passionate computer science students at
            Colorado State University. Our mission is to provide a safe and loving home for pets in need, while also
            giving them the chance to find their forever families.</p>
        <p>At Pets with Human Names, we believe that every pet deserves a chance at a happy and fulfilling life,
            regardless of their age, breed, or background. That's why we work tirelessly to ensure that each and every
            one of our animals receives the care and attention they deserve.</p>
        <p>Whether you're looking to adopt a new furry friend or simply want to support our cause, we invite you to
            explore our website and learn more about Pets Without Names. From our adoptable pets and volunteer
            opportunities to our fundraising events and educational programs, there are plenty of ways to get involved
            and make a difference in the lives of animals.</p>
