                <p>The following is a list of things I have learned either through my own experience or through working. So there will be a few just dining related tips, but you'll 
                    at least know what to do.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The NUMBER ONE peice of information I can give you is DO YOUR RESEARCH. Research like you are about to write your Master's thesis on Disney vacation planning.
                        It shocks me how many people go to Disney World and don't do any research. You need to learn how each system works before you go. If you don't know the 
                        difference between Genie, Genie Plus, Lightning Lane, and DAS and how  to use them in the most efficent way you will be lost. Don't be afraid to contact a 
                        Disney travel agent if you don't have the time to research. Just be sure to confirm they actually booked what they said they booked.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Have your trip planned months in advance. Reason for that being the early bird catches the worm. The second you are able to make dining and park reservations you
                        better have a world clock on a seperate screen and really fast internet. Some restaurants run out of reservations within a second of them opening up.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Plan for things to not go as planned. Make sure you have done so much research that your schedule can be dynamic. Things happen. Rides break down, people get 
                        tired, to maximize your vaction be flexable.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        If you have small kids plan to go back to the resort and take a nap or have rest time during the hottest part of the day. Florida is hot, the parks are gigantic, 
                        even if your kid is in a stroller all day they can get very hot and very tired extemely quickly. Last thing you want is a overtired kid or worse a kid with heat sickness.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Be prepared to be mentally and physically tired. Now this one can change based on your prefered vacation style, but how I like to do the parks is from rope 
                        drop until park close. You can maximize the ammount of time you spend in the parks and if you play your cards right you'll be able to ride every ride and see 
                        every show. Just remember the previous 2 tips.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        WATER! You need a ton of water to survive a Disney trip, but who wants to drink warm water or spend $5 for Disani water bottle. Here's what you do. Bring your own watter 
                        bottle and every time you go to a restaurant or a quick-service location the has a soda fountain and ask for multiple cups of ice water. It comes in the small kids cup, 
                        but it is completely free. Keeps you hydrated and saves you money.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When making dining reservations count the number of people who will be taking up space. Even though your 1 year old won't be eating they still take up space 
                        and need to be counted. If they're made of matter they matter.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Plan to show up to your dining reservation 30-20 minutes early. You can check in 20 minutes early and it might get you seated sooner depending on how busy the 
                        restaurant is. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        When making dining reservations, if you can't find a dining reservation for your party size, up the party size. It's a lot easier to downsize the party than it is 
                        to make a bigger table poof out of nowhere. We can sit a party of 4 at a 6 top but can't at a 2 top. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        If your family is larger than 6 (yes including the infant) there are 2 ways you can make a dining reservation. You can call guest services and see if they can 
                        make a reservation for you, or you can make multiple reservations adding up to the amount you need. If you choose the second option there is a likelyhood you will be 
                        split up. Show up early and make sure you have enough adults to where you can have at least one adult per table. The more busy the restaurant the less likely you will even sit close 
                        together. If you have the same name on the reservation around the same time, if a restraunt is able to they will try to get tables close to each other. At the cafe 
                        if people had a same name on a reservation we would try to plan to seat them together, but at a restaurant like Cinderella's Royal Table expect to be split up and not sit 
                        anywhere near each other. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Intolerences are ALLERGIES. When cchecking in we at the podium will not ask you if you have allergies to foods. Please tell the people when you are checking in 
                        for your reservation that there is an allergy or intolerence in the party. Disney takes allergies and intolerences very seriously so there is a special process 
                        for those people ordering food. We need to print special tickets for the servers and kitchen if there is an allergy. You waste time and put your own wellbeing at 
                        right by not saying you have an intolerence or an allergy. For example, I have an intolerence to eggs, so when I go to a restaurant I tell the greeter I have an 
                        allergy to eggs. The special tickets get printed and the server asks the nature of my allergy. It isn't that bad and usually ends up with me having eggs substituted 
                        for vegan eggs (which by the way Disney's vegan eggs are extremely delicious) and the kitchen makes sure no regular eggs touch my plate. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Strollers/ECVs/Wheelchairs - PLEASE SHOW UP EARLY AND TELL THE GREATERS IF YOU PLAN ON BRINGING ONE OR MORE OF THESE IN. We prefer if you leave these outside, but know 
                        sometimes you can't. 
                        A lot of restraunts are small and have small walkways. Some of the tables are not able to have a stroller/ECV/wheelchair at it because there isn't enough room. If you need 
                        it to get to the table but want to sit in a chair let us know. We can move the Strollers/ECVs/Wheelchairs for you and bring it back when you're done with your meal. Especially 
                        at small restraunts it is difficult to find a table that can accomodate these things. DON'T WAIT TO THE LAST SECOND TO TELL US THERE IS A Stroller/ECV/Wheelchair IN YOUR PARTY 
                        you may be asked to go back out so we can change your table and might have to wait a while for that new table because of it.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        If you special order something like a cake and it is a surprise have the person who booked the surprise check in and the person who the surprise is for is no where 
                        near. We need to verify you actually want something and are ok with the price. Trust me we don't want to ruin the surprise as much as you don't want it ruined. I have 
                        put balloons at a table around a corner just so a little birthday girl could be surprised as she got to her table and not see them from the front of the restaurant. 
                        We love making magic we don't want to spoil it.

                        Lastly, be nice to Cast Members! If you're kind and understanding we will try our best to move mountains of pixie dust for you. But if you don't understand the meaning of 
                        we are fully booked today and have no walk up availability and want to keep arguing until the Cast Member gives up and asks "Would you like to talk to a manager" (which for 
                        me meant "You obviously aren't listening to what I'm saying so I'm going to pass you off to my leader so I can go back to helping this long line of people with a reservation") 
                        we will do the absolute bare minimum for you. I secretly changed reservation sizes so a boyfriend could eat dinner with his girlfriend and family after he surprised her at Disney 
                        and proposed to her and not ruin the surprise for the girlfriend who made the reservation. I went and printed special coloring pages for adults because they were so chill. I went and found the last orange crayon we had because a little princes loved 
                        that color. I've coordianted with the bakery to make a special celibration treat. Give us a reason to sprinkle a little pixie dust to make your vacation more magical and 
                        we will. A good cast member is always looking for ways to make magic, you just got to give us a reason to think you're worth the pixie dust.
